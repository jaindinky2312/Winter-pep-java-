1. What are operators?
Answer: Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

2. What are the types of operators?
Answer: 1 Arithmetic
        2 Relational
        3 Logical
        4 Assignment
        5 Unary
        6 Bitwise
        7 Ternary

3. What is the difference between = and ==?
Answer: = assigns a value
        == compares two values

4. What is a ternary operator?
Answer: It is a conditional operator that works as a short form of if-else.
Syntax: condition ? value1 : value2

5. What are logical operators?
Answer: Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to combine or negate conditions.

6. What is the increment (++) operator?
Answer: It increases the value of a variable by 1.

7. What is operator precedence?
Answer: It determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.



Control Statements (8–14)

8. What are control statements?
Answer: Control statements control the flow of program execution.

9. What are the types of control statements?
Answer: Selection (if, if-else, switch)
        Iteration (loops)
        Jump (break, continue, return)

10. What is the if statement?
Answer: It executes a block of code only if the condition is true.

11. What is the difference between if-else and switch?
Answer: if-else checks multiple conditions
        switch checks a single expression against multiple values

12. What is a nested if statement?
Answer: An if statement inside another if statement.

13. What is the break statement?
Answer: It terminates the loop or switch statement immediately.

14. What is the continue statement?
Answer: It skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.


Looping (15–20)

15. What is a loop?
Answer: A loop repeatedly executes a block of code until a condition becomes false.

16. What are the types of loops?
Answer: for loop
        while loop
        do-while loop

17. What is the difference between while and do-while loop?
Answer: while checks condition first
        do-while executes at least once before checking condition

18. What is a for loop?
Answer: A loop used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

19. What is an infinite loop?
Answer: A loop that never terminates because its condition is always true.

20. When should you use break inside a loop?
Answer: When you want to stop the loop immediately based on a condition.
